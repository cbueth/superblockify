class Metric:
    """Metric object to beused with partitioners.

    A metric object is used to calculate the quality of a partitioning.
    It holds the information on several network metrics, which can be read,
    and can be used to calculate them when passing a Partitioner object.

    There are different network measures
    - d_E(i, j): Euclidean
    - d_S(i, j): Shortest path on full graph
    - d_N(i, j): Shortest path with ban through LTNs

    Attributes
    ----------
    coverage : float
        The coverage of the partitioning takes of the whole graph
    num_components : int
        The number of components in the graph
    avg_path_length : dict
        The average path length of the graph for each network measure
        {"E": float, "S": float, "N": float}
    directness : dict
        The directness of the graph for the network measure ratios
        {"ES": float, "EN": float, "SN": float}
    global_efficiency : dict
        The global efficiency of the graph for each network measure
        {"SE": float, "NE": float, "NS": float}
    local_efficiency : dict
        The local efficiency of the graph for each network measure
